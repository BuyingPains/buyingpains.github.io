	Beyond the concern of those with textile contact dermatitis, the lack of transparency in clothing production is a potential concern for the general population. The addition of formaldehyde and formaldehyde releasers to textiles demonstrates why it is important to have access to information about the chemicals in our clothes."

	lt-text = "Liz has Allergic Contact Dermatitis, which is eczema triggered by skin contact with an allergenic substance. Contact dermatitis can be caused by contact with an irritant or allergen. “All fibers can cause irritant and allergic contact dermatitis although allergic contact dermatitis is rare. For instance, people with atopic [irritant] dermatitis may find some fabrics such as wool irritating their skin lesions but it is not an allergy.” (citation missing) While the most common cause for textile contact dermatitis is occupational exposure, this is not the case for Liz. It is not clear exactly why Liz developed textile contact dermatitis and the truth is that allergists and dermatologists do not have all the answers to explain how or why someone develops a sensitization to specific chemicals.
	To identify the chemicals that Liz was reacting to, her dermatologist used a patch test. The patch test  the dermatologist will tape different patches all over the patients back, and then leave them on for 48 hours. When they are removed, wherever the person is allergic, you get a little red square, sometimes a blister, sometimes, depending on the severity of the reactions, just a little bit of redness. 
	Liz’s patch test identified over two dozen compounds Liz is allergic to, with highlights in the test’s Textiles Series and Cosmetics Series.
	How would Liz take an intimidatingly long list of allergens and use it to decide what she can wear? Her doctor recommended textiles that are least likely to be finished with formaldehyde and therefore, safest for her to wear. These textiles include 100% soft wrinkly type cotton, 100% wrinkly type linen, and 100% silk garments. For an explanation of why these garments are less likely to be finished with formaldehyde see our overview of the textile [__Supply Chain__](supplychain.html)."

In 2007, a study in the journal Contact Dermatitis estimated the worldwide prevalence of contact dermatitis to be approximately 20 percent, including minor cases such as poison ivy, as well as ... 
	Textile contact dermatitis refers specifically to allergies or irritations caused by contact with textiles. Common causes of textile contact dermatitis include dyes, rubbers, metals, resins for permanent press or flame retardancy,  and latex and acrylic fibers. 
	Populations with higher exposure to allergenic materials may show a higher prevalence of allergy. This is because individuals can develop an allergy through a process called sensitization. Because people contact different textiles depending on their social habits or occupational needs, textile contact dermatitis can be thought of as a social phenomenon. In a related example,  a 2018 study in the journal Dermatology observed higher prevalence of nickel allergy among women—tracing it to jewelry such as earrings. Because of the far higher incidence among women, nickel allergy is considered “the social allergy par excellence” (Schnuch 2018)."

	tf-text="In textile production, formaldehyde resins (such as melamine resin) can be coated onto a textile to provide wrinkle-resistance, stiffness, flame retardancy, and water repellency. Read more about it here: Stitch Diary on Medium.
	“Formaldehyde occurs naturally and is all around us” notes the American Chemistry Council’s Fact Sheet on Formaldehyde, but it is known to be toxic, carcinogenic, and allergenic to humans when present in a high enough concentration. 
	Sensitization to formaldehyde has been shown to occur through occupational exposure in several industries that use formaldehyde. 
	Beyond the concern of those with textile contact dermatitis, the lack of transparency regarding what’s in our clothing is a potential concern for the general population. The addition of Formaldehyde and Formaldehyde releasers in textiles demonstrates why it is important to have access to information about the chemicals in our clothes. 
	Concern about formaldehyde exposure, especially for children, has led policy makers to take up legislation to restrict its use. To learn more about how policy and regulation could be used to ease concern about potentially harmful exposure from our clothing see our topic on US [__Policy__](policy.html)"

	tf-text="Unregulated garment treatments is an industry-wide problem. In home furnishing, apparel, and workwear, textiles are often valued by their mechanical and chemical characteristics. Stronger and tougher garments last longer. Garments that do not wrinkle or retain odors are considered more professionally acceptable. Flame-resistant fabrics are thought to be safer.
	So, textile and garment manufacturers add treatments, coatings, and finishes to improve fabric. Unfortunately, many of these treatments enter common use before scientists understand their adverse health impacts. 
	Repeatedly, textile treatments have been deemed unsafe after years or decades of use. 
	Rachel Carson exposed the dangers of DDT, an persistent organic pollutant, in her 1962 work Silent Spring; At that point, DDT had been used for decades to give clothing bug-repellent properties. 
	As late as the 2010 and 2020s, PFAs have been used to provide moisture and temperature control to outdoor jackets, workwear, and athletic wear. PFAs and other organoflourides are now known to be persistent organic pollutants as well as possible endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Learn more with the CDC’s PFAs fact sheet and Chemical Watch’s page about PFAs on apparel. 
	Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are a class of chemicals that can interfere with a human’s endocrine system. EDCs accumulate in a body over time and are suspected to cause developmental and reproductive problems. 
	Popular flame-retardant treatments also entered scrutiny in the 2010s as possible EDCs, including brominated flame retardants like PBDE, and chlorinated flame retardants like TCDEE. pBDE is being phased out of production... (CDC on PBDE and PBB) Baby products & TB117 PEW: states vs federal TB117 & pDBE. however, products containing brominated flame retardants are still in use and having an impact. Tracing the continued presence of EDCs in clothing is a major challenge, because labels do not contain explicit information about treatments.
