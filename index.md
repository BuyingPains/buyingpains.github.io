### Read Liz's Story...

Liz is allergic to her clothes. As a child, Liz battled eczema on her arms and legs, sometimes with no discernible cause, sometimes triggered by stress and chocolate. After her third pregnancy, the eczema became more intense and persistent. Like many people with undiagnosed allergies, Liz washed up, cooled off, and waited for her rashes to pass. When flare-ups continued to appear across her body, Liz saw a dermatologist.

The diagnosis: Allergic Contact Dermatitis, which is eczema triggered by skin contact with an allergenic substance. When the dermatologist diagnosed Liz, she shared this solution: Since the human body absorbs substances through the skin, treat everything you wear as if you are slowly eating it.

The doctor provided Liz with a packet of information about each compound that showed up positively on her patch test, complete with why it is used and how to find allergen-free products.  Because clothing labels indicate fiber content but not chemical content, the dermatologist couldn’t simply say “do not wear clothing treated with formaldehyde or formaldehyde-releasing compounds.” Instead, the doctor had to provide Liz with this workaround advice.<

For example, to avoid clothing treated with formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing substances, the doctor advised avoiding permanent press clothes and blended cotton fabrics. Instead, she should seek “wrinkly-type” 100% cotton or 100% polyester. With this info, Liz was able to track down the cause of her eczema: two cotton-blend sweaters with high collars that brushed the back of her neck. The two sweaters in question were making Liz’s neck react because of her allergy to Formaldehyde Releasers. Formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing substances can be found in some plastic products, as well as in cosmetics and garments. Textile manufacturers use formaldehyde-releasing resins as preservatives in clothing. Garments with these resins can be marketed as “anti-wrinkle” and “permanent press.” Some synthetic fibers like polyester already have been engineered for wrinkle-resistant properties, so they don’t need a resin. Cotton fabrics, by contrast, require treatment to stay wrinkle free. For example, melamine resin, which is used to make cheap plastic items, can provide water-resistant and wrinkle-free outer layers for coats. Resins wear down with use and washing. When melamine breaks down, it releases formaldehyde, which is an allergen to Liz, and, under certain rare conditions, carcinogenic to everyone.

Liz is not alone: Contact Dermatitis is estimated to have an overall worldwide prevalence of 20 percent. [1] Many people in the United States worry about the chemicals in their food or sunscreens. But so few people know about the chemicals that are in our clothes.

The story of Liz’s journey of learning more about her clothing allergies raises the question: is Liz a canary in a coal mine? Considering the full range of compounds used in textile production, the dearth of information available to Liz is frustrastrating and concerning. Has Liz, who considers it unfair that she can’t find out what’s in her clothes, stumbled across systemic problems of consumer access to information in the apparel industry?
