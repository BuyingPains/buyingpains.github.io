## Site Vision
buyingpains.github.io is a not-for-profit website dedicated to improving the sustainability and public health of the global supply chain for textiles.
                        
By providing site readers with stories and educational resources, we hope to encourage informed consumption.

When consumers know what they are buying, they can more effectively influence the actions of producers.
