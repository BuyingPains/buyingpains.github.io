As a result, US consumers are largely uninformed about the chemicals in their clothing and the associated health risks. Stricter requirements on textile testing, certifying, and labeling are necessary in order to protect and inform US consumers."

	lt-text = "The current lack of regulation in the United States makes it difficult for Liz to find appropriate clothing. Liz’s problem is two-fold. Lax regulations mean that garment manufacturers do not have to meet strict requirements on the amount of potentially harmful chemicals allowed in their clothing. Making Liz’s problem even more difficult is a lack of transparency, which makes it near impossible for Liz to determine what is in her clothes. Regardless of government regulation to limit acceptable levels of specific chemicals, if garments had adequate labeling standards, Liz would be able to identify “safe” and “unsafe” clothing. At the moment Liz has to try out new clothing to see if she reacts or she has to stick to the same narrow range of brands she knows won’t give her problems. Increasing transparency would go a long way to helping people like Liz.
	If Liz were shopping in Europe, many of the problems that she faces in the United States would be mitigated by stricter regulation. Liz could be assured that the clothing she was looking at had been assessed by Reach (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals), a regulation “adopted to improve the protection of human health and the environment from the risks that can be posed by chemicals” (REACH). In the US, regulation between states is also not uniform. If state regulations such as Proposition 65 in California and the 2014 Formaldehyde ban in Minnesota were expanded to the federal  level, Liz would be safer and more informed about the chemicals in her clothes. For more information on how Liz would benefit from increased transparency in the garment supply chain see our topic on [__Transparency__](transparency.html)."

	tf-text = "In the United States the regulation of apparel and household textiles is administered by several Federal agencies. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) make up a patchwork system responsible for administering regulations associated with apparel and textiles.
	The patchwork and oftentimes voluntary chemical testing and reporting practices in the US leave US consumers largely uninformed about the chemicals in their clothing.
	In contrast to the system employed in the US, the European Union employs a single regulatory body (REACH) tasked with regulating the use of chemicals in apparel and textiles. REACH collects and assesses information regarding hazardous substances which individual companies are required to register for their compliance. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) then receives and evaluates these registrations for their compliance with REACH regulation. The burden is placed on companies to “demonstrate to ECHA how the substance can be safely used, and they must communicate the risk management measures to the users.” 
	The European Union’s requirement on strict textile testing, certifying, and labeling protects EU consumers and informs them about the potential health risks of chemical exposure from garments. We cannot say the same for US consumers. As a result of stricter regulation elsewhere and the nature of the global supply chain, “the USA is fortunate to benefit, to some extent, from global regulation” (Nedorost et al., 2017).
	The failure of US regulation to protect US consumers has created difficulties for dermatologists and patients who suffer from Contact Dermatitis. As one dermatologist explained, clothing that can be marketed or sold in Japan has to adhere to a “a very strict formaldehyde level of release” so she will advise her patients that garments from Japan may be safer. This problem is highlighted by Susan Nedorost who writes:
	“In the European Union and Japan, regulation of the textile industry by the Oeko-Tex Association allows for the production and identification of clothing that are free from allergenic dyes and high levels of [formaldehyde] release. Such clothing has the Oeko-Tex label and patients with textile-related ACD can be advised to use this label to guide their choice of clothing. In the USA, there is no government regulation of the levels of [formaldehyde] contained in fabrics nor does public data exist regarding the levels of [formaldehyde] in clothing available for sale in the USA.”
	Manufacturers may produce one product that they sell in multiple states. In many cases it may make sense for the manufacturer to comply with the most strict regulation rather than producing different products for each state."

	tf-text = "The difficulty in finding clothing that is free of potential allergens is exacerbated by inadequate labeling. In the United States, “product labeling does not include chemical treatment information for fabrics” (Mcneely et al., 2017). Increased transparency in labeling would allow conscious consumers to find answers to the question “what is in my clothes?” These are questions that might find answers through better policy and increased regulation. So what might the “perfect label” contain? Jessica Helm, a postdoctoral research fellow at Silent Spring, says that’s a “good and loaded question.”
	At the federal level, garments sold in the US are required to be labeled according to fiber content, care instructions, and country of origin.
	According to Dr. Helm, the perfect label would contain the material, polymers, dyes, and preservatives. Today, most garment labels in the US only provide information on the fiber content."

	tf-text = "Despite the relative lax federal regulation of chemicals in the United States, individual states have passed their own regulations to protect consumers.
	In 1986 California passed Proposition 65 which requires businesses to warn consumers about potential exposure to chemicals that “cause cancer, birth defects, of other reproductive harm” (OEHHA).
	In 2014 Minnesota passed a ban on formaldehyde in children’s products and of formaldehyde releasers at levels exceeding 0.05 percent.
	Several states have banned the use of flame retardants and several others require sellers of children’s products to provide notice to the state in instances where the product contains a chemical on the state’s “chemicals of concern” list.
	You, the consumer, have the power to impact the regulation of chemicals in apparel and textiles via conscious consumerism and pressuring your representatives to support increased regulation."
