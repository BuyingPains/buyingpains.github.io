The brand tag on an article of clothing contains information on the fiber content of the garment, but the tag reveals nothing about the chemicals that the garment was treated with. For the conscious consumer, this makes it difficult to be informed about what we are shopping for."

	lt-text="The lack of transparency in garment labeling makes it difficult for Liz to know what is in her clothing. Even though Liz knows the chemicals she is allergic to, she still struggles to find “safe” clothing because it is nearly impossible for her to know every material or chemical that goes into her clothing.
	Liz has discovered a “life hack” to help her identify safe clothing. First, she looks at the fiber content and makes sure that the garment is not a synthetic blend (these blends will almost always contain formaldehyde or formaldehyde releasers that were used in the production process). If the fiber looks okay then Liz reads the care label to check if the garment is “wrinkle free,” “anti-microbial,” or “anti-static.” These words all indicate to Liz that the garment likely contains formaldehyde. For more information, see our page on the textiles [__Supply Chain__] (supplychain.html)
	The fact that Liz is required to read between the lines of what the brand is willing to tell the consumer, highlights the lack of information available to Liz. Even someone like Liz, who has a lot of experience “reading between the lines,” will never be able to know for sure what is in their clothing beyond the fiber content.
	Shopping would be much easier for Liz if labels were more “complete.” For example, if all labels included a list of all garment treatments used in the production process. This “complete” label would allow Liz to identify known allergens and steer clear of those products. Even if labels did not include every treatment applied to the garment, Liz would also benefit from a certification that assured her of what was not in her clothing. If certifications like OEKO-TEX and GOTS became widely used, Liz would know to avoid products that do not have these certifications. While these certifications would not tell Liz that she could wear any certified product, they would make it easier for her to avoid products that were not certified. Non-certified products would be more likely to contain potential allergens, while certified products would be more likely to be “safe.”
	Full disclosure of all ingredients used in the production process  would be best for someone like Liz who knows what she is allergic to. That said, the lay consumer would likely find it easiest to have a good/bad type of labeling/certification system."

	tf-text="The US consumer could benefit from certification standards similar to organic certification standards that we have become familiar with for food products. One such certification, OEKO-TEX, aims to assure consumers that an OEKO-TEX certified textile “has been tested for harmful substances and that the article therefore is harmless for human health” (OEKO-TEX). This type of certification, which is popular in Europe and is in use in the United States, makes it easy for a consumer to judge a product's safety at a glance.
	A second certification standard is the global organic textile standard (GOTS citation missing). GOTS differs from OEKO-TEX in that it aims to “define requirements to ensure organic status of textiles, from harvesting of the raw materials, through environmentally and socially responsible manufacturing up to labelling in order to provide a credible assurance to the end consumer” (GOTS citation missing). Both OEKO-TEX and GOTS help to inform a consumer about what is in their clothing beyond basic information on the fiber content.
	Certifications like OEKO-TEX and GOTS do not tell the consumer everything that is in the garment, but they assure the consumer of what is not in it. These certifications are useful for the consumer particularly because they are easy to comprehend. The consumer does not need to have a detailed knowledge of various garment treatments in order to judge whether a garment is “organic” or “not organic.”
	Other types of certifications exist, such as the Responsible Down Standard which “aims to ensure that down and feathers come from animals that have not been subjected to an unnecessary harm” (Down Standard citation missing). A similar approach taken by Icebreaker, a merino company based in New Zealand, is the use of a ‘baa code,’ (playing off the term “bar code”) through which they provide detailed information about where their sheep come from, including a map with sheep stations, and how their sheep are treated, as well as additional information about how they audit steps of their garment supply chain from the sheep to the consumer. These standards aim to give the consumer more information about the supply chain their clothing comes from.

	tf-text="An alternate approach to introducing garment certification standards is to require that garment manufacturers list all materials and chemicals used in the production of the garment. Though in theory it would seem ideal to have every ingredient listed on the label, this information is only useful if the consumer knows how to use it. Disclosing all information puts a large burden on the consumer to educate themselves on how to read these labels. The consumer should not be required to have a chemistry degree in order to understand what is in their clothing. An ideal solution might be to have a full ingredient list available to the consumer should they want it, as well as a certification that could assure the consumer of a garment’s safety at a glance.
	Another option for increasing transparency around what is in our clothes would be to follow the example of proposition 65 in California.  Proposition 65, passed in 1986, requires businesses to warn consumers about potential exposure to chemicals that “cause cancer, birth defects, of other reproductive harm” (OEHHA). This approach would warn consumers about concerning chemicals without putting the burden on the consumer to do this research themselves. There are concerns about proposition 65 such as that it is too general to be useful to the consumer and that it does not distinguish between chemicals that pose high and low risk (citation missing). However, on the whole, we support efforts like proposition 65 to alert consumers about known health risks.

	tf-text="If a consumer wanted to know if their clothing was produced in ethical conditions, it would be possible to find that information but consulting resources such as Good On You or the Fashion Transparency Index which provide information about ethics, sustainability, and the social and environmental practices of clothing brands. However, if a consumer wanted to learn what chemicals were in their clothing, it would be nearly impossible to find out. A 2020 New York Times article highlighted this problem by pointing out that “the opaque nature of Chinese supply chains can make it difficult to trace exactly where cotton is sourced” (NYT citation 'missing'). This problem is not limited to Chinese supply chains.
	Another option to address the problem of transparency is to reconsider the supply chain as a whole. The Fibershed movement presents a new supply chain that aims to “develop regional and regenerative fiber systems, rebuild regional manufacturing, and connect end-users to farms and ranches through public education” (Fibershed). The concept of a Fibershed can be compared to a watershed—in this idealized version of the garment supply chain a consumer would be able to identify the farm, dye house, and textile mill at which her clothing was processed. By connecting consumers to the fiber system, this new supply chain would help to increase the amount of information that gets delivered to the end consumer.
	Instead of creating a new supply chain, a more feasible goal in the short-term is to try to improve the existing supply chain. New DNA tracking technology attempts to track garments all the way through the supply chain. A company called Applied DNA Sciences markets SigNature® T molecular tags that can be “applied at the gin, allowing for cotton to be tracked and authenticated throughout the entire supply chain, from the raw fiber stage all the way to the retail shelf” (ADNAS citation missing). DNA tracking technology is one innovative example of how companies could provide consumers with more information about their clothing.
